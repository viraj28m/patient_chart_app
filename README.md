# Patient Chart App

## Project Overview
The **Patient Chart App** is a Swift-based application designed to manage patient data and medication tracking as an electronic medical record (EMR). This project models patients, their prescribed medications, and supports safe medication management through error handling and unit testing.

## Features
- **Patient Management**: Stores essential patient information (MRN, first name, last name, date of birth, height, weight, blood type, prescribed medications).
- **Medication Management**: Handles prescription data, tracks active medications, and prevents duplicate prescriptions.
- **Error Handling**: Throws appropriate errors for duplicate medication prescriptions.
- **Unit Testing**: Comprehensive test cases to verify all functionality.
